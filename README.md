# AgenIoT

AgenIoT is a novel Large Language Model (LLM) based tool that automatically creates syntactically and semantically correct IoT automation rules based on a natural language description of the automation scenario. Our approach
performs few-shot and zero-shot learning with prompt engineering on LLM to eliminate the human effort in creating correct rules. We evaluate accuracy of our approach on a dataset of 123 smartapps of SmartThings, demonstrating that our approach creates syntactically correct rules for 84.14% of smartapp descriptions.
